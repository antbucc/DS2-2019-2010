# DS2-2019-2010
Repository created for the Distributed Systems 2 Laboratory Course. It includes all the projects realized by the students - for the three different assignments - during the overall course.

The goal of each assignment is to implement the suggested distributed algorihtm in the [Repast Simphony Simulator!](https://repast.github.io/).

Three branches have been created and are used to memorize the different assignments solutions proposed by the student (or group of students). Each solution folder must include:

* A PDF document reporting the Agent Based Model defined (Architecture of the Prototype) and the computational analysis of the implemented algorithm using the Simulator.
* A small guide to install and execute (step by step) the simulator.
* The source code of the implementation.
* (Optional) a JAR file for the simulator installer.
