# Chord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Protocol for Internet Applications
This is an implementation of the Chord algorithm in Java: the iterative version has been chosen and all the optimizations related to the successor list have been implemented. <br/>
A simulator of the algorithm is available along with the implementation thanks to Repast Simphony framework.
