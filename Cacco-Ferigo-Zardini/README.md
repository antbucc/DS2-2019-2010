# Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast
This is an implementation of the LPBCAST algorithm in Java. The current version implements both the optimizations described in the paper (age-based message purging, frequency-based memebership purging) as well as node unsubscription and mesessage retrieving procedures. A simulator of the algorithm is available along with the implementation thanks to Repast Simphony framework. 

## References
The basic algorithm and the improvements are described in *Lightweight Probabilistic Broadcast*, by P. TH. EUGSTER, R. GUERRAOUI, S. B. HANDURUKANDE, and P. KOUZNETSOV.
